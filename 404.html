        <b>The server cannot find the requested resource.</b> In the browser, this means
        the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is
        valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response
        instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized
        client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent
        occurrence on the web.
